            <h2>Explanation / Prompt / Learning</h2>
            <p>No AI used, only humans and simple drawing on paper and digitally in Figma pre-Ai - presented with Keynote. I recognized how I could apply my startup experience and help guide the team through the process in a short timeframe (3 days total) to come up with a concept and presentation.</p>
            
            <h2>Impacts, Results, Follow up</h2>
            <p>Our team won 2000 EUR prize 'most innovative Idea' competing with 250 participants at the Hackathon.
            Most unique was the support for individual family members of patients, not as family coach. .</p>
